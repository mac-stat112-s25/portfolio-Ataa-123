This plot illustrates the number of covid deaths in 2020 in each federal entity in Mexico. We see that a large number of the states saw a lower amount of deaths "relatively" (below 5000) as they are colored dark blue, but we see one entity in particular in the middle which had a much higher number of deaths (around 10000) relative to the rest of the country.

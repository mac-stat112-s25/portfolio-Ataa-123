```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
```

```{r}
tuesdata <- tt_load('2020-02-18')
fc <- tuesdata$food_consumption
```

```{r}
ggplot(fc, aes(x = food_category, y = consumption)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~country)
```
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
ggplot(fc, aes(x = consumption, color = food_category)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~country)
```

Any way of doing this is going to be hard to see, even when you open the full page, due to the large number of countries. Is there a way to change the scalling or is this just an issue regardless
